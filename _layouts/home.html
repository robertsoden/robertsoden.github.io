<p>Robert is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder working on Crisis Informatics, HCI, and STS. His research and technical practice examine the various ways in which scientific and engineering understandings of climate change and disaster shape and constrain societal responses to these challenges.</p>

<p>Robert is the co-founder of <a href="http://co-risk.org">Co-Risk Labs</a>, a worker-owned consultancy focused on effective and ethical use of science and technology in the disaster and climate change space.

<p>Prior to starting his PhD, Robert was a consultant to the World Bankâ€™s <a href="http://gfdrr.org">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)</a>, where he launched the <a href="http://opendri.org">Open Data for Resilience Initiative</a>, a worldwide effort to harness open data, civic technology, and public participation to improve disaster risk management.</p>

<p>Robert currently resides in Oakland, CA, where he is researching information systems related to sea-level rise as part of his dissertation. He is a visiting student researcher with University of California, Berkeley's <a href="http://cstms.berkeley.edu/">Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, and Society</a>, and a visiting lecturer at Stanford University, with the <a href="http://urbanresilience.stanford.edu/">Stanford Urban Resilience Initiative</a>.

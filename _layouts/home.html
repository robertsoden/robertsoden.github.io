<p>I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto working on crisis informatics, human-centered computing (HCC), and science and technology studies (STS). My research uses a range of ethnographic, participatory, and design research methods to evaluate and improve the technologies we use to understand and respond to environmental challenges like disasters and climate change.</p> 
	
<p>I have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, a Master's Degree in Natural Resources and Sustainable Development from American University and Bachelors Degrees in History and Political Science from the University of Illinois, Chicago.</p>

<p>Prior to starting my PhD, I was was a researcher at the <a href="http://cnt.org">The Center for Neighborhood Technology</a> and the <a href="http://wri.org">World Resources Institute</a>, a software developer at <a href="http://developmentseed.org">Development Seed</a>, and a consultant to the World Bankâ€™s <a href="http://gfdrr.org">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)</a>. At GFDRR I launched the <a href="http://opendri.org">Open Data for Resilience Initiative</a>, a worldwide effort to harness open data, open source software, and civic technology to improve disaster and climate risk management. I am also a co-founder and member of the <a href="http://hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>, an international organization working towards creating a free and open map of the world for humanitarian and development purposes.</p>

<p>While a PhD student at CU Boulder, I was visiting student researcher with University of California, Berkeley's <a href="http://cstms.berkeley.edu/">Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, and Society</a>, and a visiting researcher and lecturer with the <a href="http://urbanresilience.stanford.edu/">Stanford Urban Resilience Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>Robert is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder working on crisis informatics, human-centered computing (HCC), and science and technology studies (STS). His research examines the  ways in which the computational tools and information standards that support our understandings of the environment shape and societal responses to disasters and climate change. Robert holds a Master's Degree in Natural Resources and Sustainable Development from American University and Bachelors Degrees in History and Political Science from the University of Illinois, Chicago.</p>

<p>Prior to starting his PhD, Robert was a professional software developer and consultant to the World Bankâ€™s <a href="http://gfdrr.org">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)</a>, where he launched the <a href="http://opendri.org">Open Data for Resilience Initiative</a>, a worldwide effort to harness open data, open source software, and civic technology to improve disaster and climate risk management.</p>

<p>Robert is currently conducting fieldwork for his dissertation in Oakland, CA on information systems related to sea-level rise. While a student at CU Boulder, he has also been a visiting student researcher with University of California, Berkeley's <a href="http://cstms.berkeley.edu/">Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, and Society</a>, and a visiting researcher and lecturer with the <a href="http://urbanresilience.stanford.edu/">Stanford Urban Resilience Initiative</a>. Robert is on the job market AY 2018-19.</p>

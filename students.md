<h3>I am currently recruiting Master's and PhD students for Fall 2021.</h3>

<p>If you are interested in working with me, please <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/programs">apply to one of our graduate programs</a>. If you are already a student at UofT and would like to collaborate, <a href="mailto:soden@cs.toronto.edu">email me</a>.</p> 

<p>I am particularly interested in working with students who have interest in computing technologies related to environmental issues, disasters, and/or international development. Most of my projects involve some combination of qualitative or ethnographic research, human-centered design, or participatory methodologies. Some of my projects also incorporate historical research or critical and speculative design.</p>

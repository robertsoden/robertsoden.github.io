<p>If you are interested in working with me, please apply to one of our graduate programs in <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/programs">Computer Science</a> or <a href="https://www.environment.utoronto.ca/graduate">The School of the Environment</a>. If you are already a student at UofT and would like to collaborate, <a href="mailto:soden@cs.toronto.edu">email me</a>.</p> 

<p>My lab group studies the information systems we use to make sense of environmental challenges, and in particular disasters and climate change. We publish primarily in HCI venues such as <a href="https://chi2021.acm.org/">CHI</a>, <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/">CSCW</a>, and <a href="https://dis.acm.org/2020/">DIS</a>. In addition to being grounded in technical aspects of computer science, most of our projects also involve some combination of qualitative or ethnographic research, human-centered design, or participatory methodologies. Some also incorporate historical research or critical and speculative design techniques. Background in these methods is helpful though not required, as they can be learned through coursework and supervised research projects. Current and former members of my group include:</p>

<p>All of our research is conducted in collaboration with important organizations and communities in the field. Examples of past or current partners include the <a href="https://www.hurricanes.gov/">US National Hurricane Center</a>, <a hef="https://mutualaid.nyc/">Mutual Aid NYC</a>, the <a href="http://gfdrr.org">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery</a>, and the <a href="http://hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>.</p>

<p>Over the course of each student's graduate studies, they will be expected to develop and execute their own independent research programs with mentorship from myself and other faculty and the support and collaboration of other students. For an idea of some of the ongoing work that new students can get involved with as they begin to develop their own agenda or to broaden their experience, visit the <a href="/projects/">current projects page</a>.   
	
<p><a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/">The Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto</a> is a leading program in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI), with incredible opportunities for student research, mentorship, and development. Recent graduates from our department have gone on to meaningful careers in academia, industry, and beyond. Students will also have the opportunity to get involved with the many other initiatives around campus including the <a href="https://ethics.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Center of Ethics</a>, the <a href="https://www.torontosri.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.mcluhancentre.ca/">McLuhan Center</a>, and the <a href="https://technosalon.wordpress.com/">Technoscience Salon</a>.
